## Current Priorities
- update pyproject.toml
- update requirements.txt and requirements-dev.txt
- unify ids, generation and usage, more linability
- remove emojis from cli
- unifiy output styling

- remove newspaper subtitle

### Data Issues
- Images need fixing too

- **Data integrity: Mixed issues in same directory**
  - 12 directories have ALTO files from multiple issues mixed together (0.09% of data)
  - Example: `1901/03/19/01` has issue 103 METS but contains ALTO files from both 103 and 104
  - Issue 103: Missing pages 13-20 (expected by METS, not found)
  - Issue 104: Has pages 1-8 in wrong directory with no METS file
  - Images are also affected/mixed up
  - Need to investigate if files are mislabeled or if data is genuinely incomplete
  - Validation command exists: `newspaper-explorer data validate-alto-mets --source der_tag`
  - Detection in fixes.py exists but no automatic repair (returns 0)
  - **Action**: Manual investigation of source data or contact data provider

- Finish downloading and fixing dataset -> Final testing

### Features
- CLI option to cleanup downloads
- Page Classification using DONUT -> Detect Ads?
- Update EntityExtractor to use preprocessed data (remove inline normalization)
